I checked your GitHub repository. It is a **React app bootstrapped with Vite**. Hereâ€™s what I found and how to fix deployment issues:

---

### âœ… **Key Observations**

1. The project uses **Vite** (not Create React App).
2. The `vite.config.js` doesnâ€™t have a `base` path configured for GitHub Pages deployment.
3. Your `package.json` does **not** define a `homepage` field (needed for GitHub Pages).
4. Vite by default assumes the app will be served from `/`, but on GitHub Pages itâ€™s served from `/<repo-name>/`.

---

### ðŸ”¥ **Why deployment might be failing**

If youâ€™re deploying to **GitHub Pages**, the app likely breaks because:

* The static files are being requested from `/` instead of `/<repo-name>/`.
* Viteâ€™s default build output isnâ€™t configured for subdirectory hosting.

---

### ðŸ›  **Fix for GitHub Pages Deployment**

1. **Add `base` in `vite.config.js`:**

   ```js
   // vite.config.js
   export default defineConfig({
     base: '/SATs/', // Use your repo name here
     plugins: [react()],
   });
   ```
2. **Add homepage in `package.json`:**

   ```json
   "homepage": "https://iamkamalpandey.github.io/SATs",
   ```
3. **Install GitHub Pages package:**

   ```bash
   npm install --save gh-pages
   ```
4. **Update `package.json` scripts:**

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "predeploy": "npm run build",
     "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
   }
   ```
5. **Deploy:**

   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

### ðŸš€ Alternative: Deploy to Vercel or Netlify (Much Easier)

* Create an account at [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
* Connect your GitHub repo.
* No need to set the `base` path.
* The deployment will work instantly.

---

### âœ… Recommendation

If youâ€™re targeting **GitHub Pages**, apply the **Vite `base` fix** above.
If you want **fast, no-configuration deployment**, use **Vercel** or **Netlify**.

Do you want me to:
âœ… **update and prepare the full fixed code for GitHub Pages**?
âœ… Or create a **Vercel-ready setup** for you?
Which one do you prefer?
